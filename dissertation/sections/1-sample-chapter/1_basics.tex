\section{Basics}
\label{intro:basics}

The Ramones are a great band from \gls{nyc}.  Probably even better than you
remember. There have been books written about them, like ``Hey Ho Let's Go: The
Story of the Ramones: The Story of The Ramones''~\cite{true2010hey} and ``Jews,
punk and the Holocaust: from the Velvet Underground to the Ramones--the
Jewish-American story''~\cite{stratton2005jews}.

As \ref{fig:logo} shows, they had a great logo too.  And they wrote amazing
albums, like \gls{rtr} and \gls{eofc}, and a couple more.  They even did
three (!) jingles for Steel Reserve\footnote{The gross malt liquor.}
