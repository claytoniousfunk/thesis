\label{qgp:qcd}

The Standard Model of Particle Physics is a highly descriptive quantum field theory that describes fundamental particle interactions.
It explains the fundamental strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions, which correspond to the group structure SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1).
The model predicts the existance of 12 fermions which make up all matter in the universe, and 5 bosons which act as force carriers.
Quantum chromodynamcs is the SU(3) part of the Standard Model that describes the strong interactions between colored quarks and gluons.

The Lagrangian of QCD is given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}} = \sum_q \bar{\psi}_{q,a} \left( i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \delta_{ab} - g_s \gamma^\mu t_{ab}^{C} A_{\mu}^C - m_q \delta_{ab}\right)\psi_{q,b} - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{A} F^{A\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where pairs of indices are summed over and $\delta_{ab}$ is the Dirac-delta operator.
The $\gamma^\mu$ are the Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, which embed spin dynamics of fermions.
The $\psi_{q,a}$ are quark fields for a quark of flavor $q$, mass $m_q$, and color-index $a$ (which runs from 1 to 3).
The $A_\mu^C$ represent the gluon fields, with the index $C$ running from 1 to 8, meaning there are 8 types of gluons.
The $t_{ab}^C$ represent the generators of the SU(3) group, and correspond to 3$\times$3 matrices which embed the color dynamics on the quark/gluon interaction.
The quantity $g_s = \sqrt{4\pi\alpha_s}$ is the QCD coupling constant.
The gluon field tensor $F^{A}_{\mu\nu}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  F_{\mu\nu}^A = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu^A - \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}_\mu^A - g_s f_{ABC} \mathcal{A}_\mu^B \mathcal{A}_\mu^C
  \label{eqn:gluon-field-tensor}
\end{equation}
where $f_{ABC}$ are the structure constants of SU(3) and are defined by $[t^A,t^B] = if_{ABC}t^C$.
Note that the third term Eq. \ref{eqn:gluon-field-tensor} distinguishes QCD (the strong interaction), from QED (the electromagentic interaction).
This term gives rise to the triplet and quartic gluon self-interaction terms, which can be seen in the Feynman diagrams of QCD shown in Fig. \ref{fig:feynman-diagrams}.

Quarks and gluons are never observed in isolation, and instead always form into hadrons as color-neutral combinations of quarks, anti-quarks, and gluons.
This phenomena is known as \textit{color confinement}.
This occurs because, at low interaction energies, the strong force coupling (given by $g_s$, or, equivalently, $\alpha_s$) is strong.
The reason for this phenomena is not immediately intuitive, and stems from the renormalization scheme for $\alpha_s$.
The running coupling of the strong interaction strength $\alpha_s$ is derived from the renormlization group equation
\begin{equation}
  Q^2 \cfrac{\partial \alpha_s}{\partial Q^2} = \beta(\alpha_s)
  \label{eqn:RGE}
\end{equation}
where the QCD $\beta$-function has the following perturbative expansion:
\begin{equation}
  \beta(\alpha_s) = -b \alpha_s^2 \left[1 + b'\alpha_s + O(\alpha_s^2)\right]
\end{equation}
If we only keep the lowest order terms, Eq. \ref{eqn:RGE} becomes
\begin{equation}
  Q^2 \cfrac{\partial \alpha_s}{\partial Q^2} \approx -b \alpha_s^2
\end{equation}
which has the solution
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_s \approx \cfrac{1}{b\ln\left(\frac{Q^2}{\Lambda^2}\right)}
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ comes from the choice of the constant of integration, and represents the scale at which the coupling will diverge.
While the exact value for $\Lambda$ is definition-dependent, it is often quoted as about 200 MeV.
Near the mass scale of light hadrons ($Q \sim 1$ GeV), $\alpha_s$ is large, which leads to the confinement of quarks and gluons inside hadrons.
For high interaction energies, $\alpha_s$ becomes small, and the strong force becomes small.
This phenomena is known as \textit{asymptotic freedom}.
