\label{qgp:qcd}

The Standard Model of Particle Physics is a highly descriptive quantum field theory that describes fundamental particle interactions.
It explains the electromagnetic, electroweak, and strong interactions to very high precision.
Quantum chromodynamcs is the part of the Standard Model that describes the strong interactions between colored quarks and gluons.
Interactions are modeled via the SU(3) Lie algebra.
The Lagrangian of QCD is given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \sum_q \bar{\psi}_{q,a} \left( i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \delta_{ab} - g_s \gamma^\mu t_{ab}^{C} A_{\mu}^C - m_q \delta_{ab}\right)\psi_{q,b} - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{A} F^{A\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where pairs of indices are summed over.
The $\gamma^\mu$ are the Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, which embed spin dynamics of fermions.
The $\psi_{q,a}$ are quark fields for a quark of flavor $q$, mass $m_q$, and color-index $a$ (which runs from 1 to 3).
The $A_\mu^C$ represent the gluon fields, with the index $C$ running from 1 to 8, meaning there are 8 types of gluons.
The $t_{ab}^C$ represent the generators of the SU(3) group, and correspond to 3$\times$3 matrices, and embed the color dynamics on the quark/gluon interaction.
The quantity $g_s = \sqrt{4\pi\alpha_s}$ is the QCD coupling constant.
The field tensor $F^{A}_{\mu\nu}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  F_{\mu\nu}^A = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu^A - \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}_\mu^A - g_s f_{ABC} \mathcal{A}_\mu^B \mathcal{A}_\mu^C
\end{equation}
The third term in the field tensor represents the self-coupling of the gluon field: a unique feature of QCD.
The Feynman diagrams that represent the allowed interactions for QCD are shown in
